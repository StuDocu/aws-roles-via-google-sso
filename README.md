# AWS Roles via Google SSO

## Introduction
This repository holds the code for a browser extension that allows users that use
Google Workspace (gsuite) as an IDP provider to login
to AWS using roles.
It also has a local service that updates the local client AWS credentials for the aws-cli.
This extension can be used as an alternative to `aws-google-auth` and doesn't require filling credentials as long as your Google account is logged in to your browser, nor does it suffer from constant captchas.
The extension has been tested on Chrome and firefox.

## Features
- Refresh AWS Web Console session automatically to keep user logged in.
- Get temporary credentials for assumed role to use for CLI access.
- Autofill all available AWS roles for Google Workspace account.
- Automatically update local aws credentials file.
